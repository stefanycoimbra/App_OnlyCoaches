* Each `user/student` receives a personalized workout for his or her needs, be it the prevention of diseases or muscular development, with qualified professionals.
* The `professional`, with the help of the app, has resources to present a specific training plan for the student, as well as videos and access to a communication channel between the two of them.
* At a periodic interval of time, reassessments can be made. In addition, the provides a community the opportunity for users to share their goals and progress.

In order to validate the idea of the system, a complete display prototype was developed, with the functionalities of buttons and interactive flow for the user, in order for the latter to be the target of the user experience metrics.
Thus, for all the development of screens and modules, [`Figma`](https://www.figma.com/) was used, chosen for being a professional and practical environment in the design of mobile and web prototypes. The development was up to the team, which was divided into: work on the prototype, tests, and system documentation. To identify all the screens and not get lost in the needs of the prototype, we also created a [`Trello`](https://trello.com/) with the goal of using the agile methodology from the beginning of the project.
